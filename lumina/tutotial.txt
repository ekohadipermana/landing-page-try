use open sans font from google
use font awesome
organize the files into folders
go section after section in order that is how
the larger project goes

use div for header : container and header-flex class
use max-width 1100px

for css use class like:
.header .main-menu 

create a media responsive on every section step! 

Copy Bootstrap traits a lot by creating 
classes

use container class for big and smaller container

use rem a lot for responsiveness

remember to create responsive media queries
on every section process, dont wait until 
all finished!
